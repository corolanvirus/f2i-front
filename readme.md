## init du projet

Install Node.js and `npm` with `nvm`:

```bash
nvm install node

nvm use node
```

Replace 'node' with 'latest' for `nvm-windows`.

Then install Parcel:

```bash
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine:



```bash
cd f2i-front
npm install
```

Start development server:

```
npm run start
```

To create a production build:

```
npm run build
```

Production files will be placed in the `dist` folder. Then upload those files to a web server. ðŸŽ‰

## Project Structure

```
    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ dist
    â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
    â”œâ”€â”€ public
    â”œâ”€â”€ src
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scenes
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HelloWorldScene.js
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
```



## Static Assets

Any static assets like images or audio files should be placed in the `public` folder. It'll then be served at http://localhost:8000/images/my-image.png

Example `public` structure:

```
    public
    â”œâ”€â”€ images
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ my-image.png
    â”œâ”€â”€ music
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    â”œâ”€â”€ sfx
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

They can then be loaded by Phaser with `this.image.load('my-image', 'images/my-image.png')`.

## Class Properties Support

This template includes class property support out of the box using `@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties`.

A `.babelrc` is included as well as the use of `babel-eslint` as the parser for ESLint.

# ESLint

This template uses a basic `eslint` set up for code linting to help you find and fix common problems in your JavaScript code.

It does not aim to be opinionated.

[See here for rules to turn on or off](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/).


## Dev Server Port

You can change the dev server's port number by modifying the `start` script in `package.json`. We use Parcel's `-p` option to specify the port number.

The script looks like this:

```
parcel src/index.html -p 8000
```

Change 8000 to whatever you want.
